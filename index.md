## Improve Engagement

People are going to be on their phones anyway. Why not make the content they're looking at relevant to the discussion?
Give them {term}`ancillary` material to interact with and get a deeper understanding of your message.

## Share Effectively

People are taking pictures of your slides? It must be interesting content! Too bad they just have a grainy picture of those beautiful graphs.
Give your audience material that will embed your thoughts in their brains and keep them coming back for more!

## Continue the Conversation

You spent hours preparing that presentation. Why should the conversation be limited to that event?
Continue the conversation with your audience and understand how your message is being heard.
Give yourself a chance to engage with your audience that's better than a YouTube comment section.
